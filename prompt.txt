@workspace /new scaffold code for a project with Python, Streamlit, Docker, and Docker Compose to compare two stocks performances.

- The API should get data from Yahoo Finance using the yfinance library.
- The Streamlit interface should be as follows:
  1) One input field for the first stock ticker (defaults to APPL)
  2) One input field for the second stock ticker (defaults to NVDA).
  3) A button to submit the form with text "Compare".
  4) A line chart showing the stock prices of the two stocks.
- Do not add comments to the file names.
- Name the Dockerfile file as Dockerfile.stocks.
