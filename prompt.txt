@workspace /new scaffold code for a project with Python, Streamlit, Docker, and Docker Compose to compare two stocks performances.

- The API should get data from Yahoo Finance using the yfinance library.
- The Streamlit interface should be as follows:
  1) One input field for the first stock ticker (defaults to APPL)
  2) One input field for the second stock ticker (defaults to NVDA).
  3) A button to submit the stocks tickers with text "Compare".
  4) A line chart showing the stock prices of the two stocks (if button is clicked).
- Do not add comments to the file names.
- Name the Dockerfile file as Dockerfile.stocks.
- Be sure to add all requirements to requirements.txt.
- Make a bash script to run localy and other to run on docker.
